Assignment 8

how you modified the design of your game and why (including UI design and Sound design)

--UI DESIGN--

-Added a cheat sheat next to the laptop to help the player interact with it
-Changes the text colors in the terminal from highly saturated to pastel colors
-Added Post Processing, which enhanced the level design to match the theme of the game. Noticeable shadows in the trees and throughout the world. The colors are more rich and compliment the theme of a dreamy, perfect world. The lighting is harsher, however; it ties very well into the dreamy theme

--SOUND--
Various different ambient background noise files were used in different parts of the map. These noises help set the eerie tone of the game and make the player feel lonely. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OIlsv6-pYE
Computer noise is triggered when the player interacts with the laptop. We chose to include this sound because it gives the player an indication that they have opened the laptop. Source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8w-2lzM-C4&list=PLfuFOjomlToPlken_o2gY2GSYaG3j6Nh2
Ding sound occurs when the player runs into an object that they can collect and add to inventory. This was added to alert the player that the item was collectable and not just another game object. 
Cricket noise outside helps set the tone of the game. Game should be enigmatic and cricket sounds give off that mysterious vibe. Rustling leaves sound effect was added for the same reason.
Open door sound effect that is triggered when the character walks through a door. This is a puzzle/exploration game. A lot of small details like an opening door sound are very useful in setting up the environment.
Stair sound effect occurs when the player goes up/down stairs. This is the same as with the opening door sound.
Fire crackling sound was added to the fire at the campsite to make the environment seem more realistic. 
Lamp switching on/off sound effect was added so the player can hear and see when they are turning a lamp on/off.
We rejected some ambient noise selections because they were too suspenseful and dramatic for the part of the game we are currently at.
We rejected the key-in-lock sound effect for the doors because most of the doors are not locked so the player doesnâ€™t need a key.
*Note: all sounds without sources were gotten from the YouTube Audio Library (https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/soundeffects?ar=1586916063028&nv=1)
