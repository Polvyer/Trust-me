Assignment 7

--AI and Mecanim--
1. Gina used AI/mecanim to create a cat character that walks around the first floor of the house and helps give the player a sense of home.
   Found a cat model with animations and implemented the slow walk animation. 
   Created a NavMesh for the house and made the cat a navigation agent.
   Added points on the mesh for pathfinding and added them to a list so the cat can walk to them in a random order. 
   Followed the NavMesh tutorial and used code from here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Navigation.html.
